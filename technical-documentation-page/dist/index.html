          <p>Linux is a community of open-source Unix like operating systems that are based on the Linux Kernel. It was initially released by Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991. It is a free and open-source operating system and the source code can be modified and distributed to anyone commercially or noncommercially under the GNU General Public License.</p>
          <p>Initially, Linux was created for personal computers and gradually it was used in other machines like servers, mainframe computers, supercomputers, etc. Nowadays, Linux is also used in embedded systems like routers, automation controls, televisions, digital video recorders, video game consoles, smartwatches, etc. The biggest success of Linux is Android(operating system) it is based on the Linux kernel that is running on smartphones and tablets. Due to android Linux has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems. Linux is generally packaged in a Linux distribution. </p>

    <article>
      <p>A file system is a logical collection of files on a partition or disk. A partition is a container for information and can span an entire hard drive if desired.</p>
<p>
Your hard drive can have various partitions which usually contain only one file system, such as one file system housing the /file system or another containing the /home file system.</p>
<p>
One file system per partition allows for the logical maintenance and management of differing file systems.</p>
<p>
Everything in Unix is considered to be a file, including physical devices such as DVD-ROMs, USB devices, and floppy drives.</p>

    <header>Shell</header>
    <article>
      <p>A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.</p>
<p>
Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs, and shell scripts. There are different flavors of a shell, just as there are different flavors of operating systems. Each flavor of shell has its own set of recognized commands and functions.</p>
      <p><strong>Shell types</strong></p>
      <p>
        In Unix, there are two major types of shells −</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bourne shell</strong> − If you are using a Bourne-type shell, the $ character is the default prompt.</p>
<p>
    <strong>C shell</strong> − If you are using a C-type shell, the % character is the default prompt.

    <article>
      <p> Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.</p>
<p>
Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing configuration files.</p>
<p>
Despite what the above comic suggests, Vim can be configured to work in a very simple (Notepad-like) way, called evim or Easy Vim. </p>
      <p>Example : </p>
      <code>vim filename </code>
